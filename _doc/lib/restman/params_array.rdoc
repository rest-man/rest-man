The ParamsArray class is used to represent an ordered list of [key, value]
pairs. Use this when you need to include a key multiple times or want
explicit control over parameter ordering.

Most of the request payload & parameter functions normally accept a Hash of
keys => values, which does not allow for duplicated keys.
