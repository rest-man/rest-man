:call-seq:
  normalize_url(url) -> string

Normalize a URL by adding a protocol if none is present.

If the string has no HTTP-like scheme (i.e. scheme followed by '//'), a
scheme of 'http' will be added. This mimics the behavior of browsers and
user agents like cURL.

[Parameters:]

  - *url* (String) -- A URL string.
