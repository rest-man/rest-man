  .default_ssl_cert_store -> OpenSSL::X509::Store

Return a certificate store that can be used to validate certificates with
the system certificate authorities. This will probably not do anything on
OS X, which monkey patches OpenSSL in terrible ways to insert its own
validation. On most *nix platforms, this will add the system certifcates
using OpenSSL::X509::Store#set_default_paths. On Windows, this will use
RestMan::Windows::RootCerts to look up the CAs trusted by the system.
