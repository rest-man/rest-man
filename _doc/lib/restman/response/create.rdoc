Initialize a Response object. Because RestMan::Response is
(unfortunately) a subclass of String for historical reasons,
Response.create is the preferred initializer.

[Parameters:]

  - *body* (String, nil) -- The response body from the Net::HTTPResponse
  - *net_http_res* (Net::HTTPResponse)
  - *request* (RestMan::Request)
  - *start_time* (Time)
