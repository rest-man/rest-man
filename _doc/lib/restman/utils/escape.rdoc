Encode string for safe transport by URI or form encoding. This uses a CGI
style escape, which transforms ` ` into `+` and various special
characters into percent encoded forms.

This calls URI.encode_www_form_component for the implementation. The only
difference between this and CGI.escape is that it does not escape `*`.
